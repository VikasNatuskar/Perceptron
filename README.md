Perceptron Based Classification - using MNIST [Handwritten Digit] dataset

## Problem Scenario
You are hired by one of the major AI giants, planning to build the best image 
classifier model available till date. In the first phase of model development, the input is passed 
from the MNIST dataset. MNIST dataset is one of the most common datasets used for image 
classification and is accessible from many different sources. It is a subset of a larger set available 
from NIST and contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images on handwritten digits 
taken from American Census Bureau employees and American high school students.
